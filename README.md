## React Trivia App

This project is a single-page React application that allows users to view trivia questions and reveal the answers upon clicking a button.

### Components

#### Header Component

The Header component displays a site name link.

#### Question Component

The Question component is responsible for displaying a trivia question along with a button to reveal the answer. It utilizes state variables to manage the category, question text, answer text, and whether the answer is revealed or not. The component also utilizes the useEffect hook to fetch a random true/false type question from an API endpoint upon component mount.

### Usage

```bash
npm install
```

```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
